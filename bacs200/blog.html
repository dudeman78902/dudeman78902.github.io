				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>2.Cryptocurrencies are decentralized.This means that one person does not own or control bitcoin.For example the United States Dollar is centralised as the federal reserve single handedly controls the decision making for the US Dollar</th>

				<tr>
					<th>3.Free to send money to anyone,anywhere in the world.With Bitcoin and other crypto currencies there are no or very little fees.Gone are the days of using a serivce like Western Union to send money to family and friends</th>

		<h2>What is Blockchain ?</h2>
	<p>Like mentioned earler a Block Chain is esentially just a Digital Ledger Book.This means that every transaction on a blockchain is recorded which can be very helpful as you know what has happend in the past.According to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/blockchain-for-beginners/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide-to-digital-money">Coin Telegraph.com</a> a blockhain is a "Blockchain is a type of DLT where transactions are recorded using a hash, which is an immutable cryptographic signature. This means that if a single block in a chain is modified, it will be immediately clear that the chain has been tampered with".We can see how this functionality may be helpful in recording financial transactions of large companys.    </p>

		<h2>What is the Future of Crypto ?</h2>
		<p>I can't tell you exactly what the Future of Crypto is because if I read minds Iwouldnt be writing this,haha.However,I can give you my best guess hehe.I believe that in the next 10 years you will start to see payment options for crypto currencies become more and more common at common retail stores.I also think the blockchain technolgy will be more common and widely used especially by Comapanys and large organizations</p>
